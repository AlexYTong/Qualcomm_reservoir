SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
##################

RaspberryPi (RPI)

Once the program is downloaded from gitHub, run the command:
"sudo sh setup.sh"
in Qualcomm_reservoir directory.

This script will setup the following:
    The polipo web proxy cache and dependencies (assuming a raspbian OS)
    Automatic login for the RPI
    Automatic start of the polipo program at login

Tablet

To tether a android based tablet to the program, click on the Setting button
in the main menu. Make sure wi-fi is enabled and register for the desired
network. In the menu, enter the password and before clicking continue, click 
the show advanced options box. Further options should appear, the first a
"Proxy settings" drop-down menu. In this menu, the user should select the "Manual"
option. Under the "Proxy host name" option, the IP address of the Pi should be
entered. Finally under "Proxy port", "8123" should be entered. Press the connect
button, and the tablet should be setup to use the raspberry pi proxy on that
local network.

Note: as of Feb 2015, android tablets are set to ignore a proxy server if they
are unable to connect to the specified device.
