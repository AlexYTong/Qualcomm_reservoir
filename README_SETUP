This project implements a raspberry pi based web server cache ..

SET-UP

Pi

Once the program is downloaded from gitHub, run the command:
"sudo sh setup.sh"
in Qualcomm_reservoir folder.

This will completely set up the program on the RaspberryPi and ensure the
caching system will automatically be engaged each time the Pi is turned on.


Tablet

To tether the tablet to the program, click on the Setting button in the main
menu. Make sure wi-fi is turned on and in that menu, click on the desired
network. In the menu, enter the password and before clicking continue, click 
the show advanced options box. 
Further options should show up, the first being a "Proxy settings" drop-down 
menu. In this menu, the user should select the "Manual" option.
Under the "Proxy host name" option, the IP address of the Pi should be entered.
This will either be provided or, if you are the one running the Pi setup with
a monitor, the monitor will show the IP address as the last thing after setup.
Finally under "Proxy port", "8123" should be entered. After this, the user push
the "Connect" button and the tablet should be connected to the system.

If the user pressed "Connect" before checking "Show Advanced Options," the user
can select the network again and press the "Forget" button before retrying.
