This project implements a raspberry pi based web server cache using the proxy
cacheing codebased named Polipo on a Raspbian based OS. 

This project has many applications in developing nations where wired
infrastructure necessary to support today's modern 3G devices is not yet
available everywhere. This cache has the largest benefits to medium sized
networks smaller than roughly 100 nodes. With many devices attempting to access
similar data-sets. This creates a cheap localization effect similar to the more
expensive CDN's developing around the globe.

Credit to the Qualcomm Tech Mentors at the hackathon for their endless patience
with our never ending questions
