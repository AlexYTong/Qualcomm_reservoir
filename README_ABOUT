This is the ABOUT documentation for the Qualcomm Reservoir platform created
during the 2015 IDHacks at Tufts University.

The SETUP information can be found in the SETUP_README file.

The Reservoir system works by simulating a cache on a Raspberry Pi by
utilizing the Polipo program. The Raspberry Pi acts as a proxy -- 
devices, such as the students' tablets, will communicate with a network,
such as a BRCK, via the Raspberry Pi. Client requests, such as lesson 
information,are cached in the Raspberry Pi so that further requests bounce
back from the proxy with the correct request answers without further data 
consumption from the network.

The .iso provided aims to deliver a solution that can be set up/deployed by
teachers with no knowledge of Linux systems or minimal tech literacy.
